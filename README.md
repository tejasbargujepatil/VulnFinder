This repository contains Python scripts for detecting and prioritizing security vulnerabilities in websites. The scripts are designed to be used sequentially to comprehensively assess website security.

## 1. Vulnerability Finder

**Description**: This script scans websites for SQL injection, CSRF, security misconfigurations, and IDOR vulnerabilities.

**Usage**:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tejasbargujepatil/VulnFinder.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Vulnerability Finder Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd web-security-script/VulnFinder
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:

   ```bash
   python VulnFinder.py
   ```

4. **Enter the URL of the Website to Scan**:

   When prompted, enter the URL of the website you want to scan.

5. **Review Scan Results**:

   The script will perform scans for SQL injection, CSRF, security misconfigurations, and IDOR vulnerabilities and display the results.

## 2. Subdomain Scan

**Description**: This script scans subdomains of websites for vulnerabilities.

**Usage**:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tejasbargujepatil/web-security-scripts.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Subdomain Scan Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd web-security-scripts/Subdomain_Scan
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:

   ```bash
   python Subdomain_Scan.py
   ```

4. **Enter the URL of the Website to Scan**:

   When prompted, enter the URL of the website whose subdomains you want to scan.

5. **Review Scan Results**:

   The script will perform subdomain scans and display the results.

## 3. Vuln Priority

**Description**: This script tests SQL injection and other vulnerability payloads on websites and prioritizes the vulnerabilities.

**Usage**:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tejasbargujepatil/web-security-scripts.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Vuln Priority Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd web-security-scripts/Vuln_Priority
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:

   ```bash
   python Vuln_Priority.py
   ```

4. **Enter the URL of the Website to Scan**:

   When prompted, enter the URL of the website you want to scan.

5. **Review Scan Results**:

   The script will test SQL injection and other vulnerability payloads on the website and prioritize the vulnerabilities.
